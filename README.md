# Data Component Use Case for Wavewatch3 Wave Power Calculation

Waves enhance sediment resuspension from the seabed and shorelines. Wave power is often correlated to shoreline erosion and is used to assess feasibility of renewable wave energy generation. This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the CSDMS data component to download surface wave properties from the WAVEWATCH III model (Booij et al., 1999) output for a given time period, interpolate it to a specific location, and calculate the wave power over time at that point.
