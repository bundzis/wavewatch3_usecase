# Data Component Use Case for Wavewatch3 Wave Power Calculation

Version 1: Surface wave properties are important for quantifying dynamical processes such as wave power and bottom shear stress on the seafloor. This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the CSDMS data component to download the Wavewatch3 dataset and use these data to look at surface wave properties in a specific location in the Gulf of Mexico and calculate the wave power at this location.

Version 2: Surface wave properties are important for calculating bottom shear stress on the seafloor. Bottom shear stress can then be used, along with sediment data, to calcualte sediment resuspension and transport in the water column near the seabed. These surface wave properties include significant wave height, peak wave period, peak wave direction, wind speed in the east-west direction, and wind speed in the north-south direction. This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to use the CSDMS data component to download the wave dataset and use these data to look at surface wave properties in a specific location in the Gulf of Mexico and calculate the wave power at this locations.
